## 1. Sales Performance Analysis using P1-AmazingMartEU2 Dataset

Using the **P1-AmazingMartEU2** dataset, I developed a Tableau dashboard to analyze sales performance across multiple regions in Europe.

### Dashboard Features

- **Map of Total Sales and Profit Margins**: A map showcasing total sales and profit margins by region in Europe.
- **Scatter Plot of Sales vs. Profit**: A scatter plot comparing sales versus profit for different customers over various years.

### Visual Insights

- **Regional Performance**: The map visualization helps identify which regions in Europe have the highest sales and profit margins, providing a quick overview of geographic performance.
- **Customer Profitability**: The scatter plot enables a detailed analysis of customer sales and profitability, revealing patterns and trends across different years.
